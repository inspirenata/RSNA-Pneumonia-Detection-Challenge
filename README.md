# RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-Challenge

Here will be my code belongs to the Kaggle competition RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge.
The goal of this challenge is to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, the algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.
